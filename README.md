Project Repo for Cisco Webex Hackathon 2020: Gratition

 Gratition is a mental easing web app that relies on HTML/CSS/ and pure Javascript. Using various prompts for the user and utilizing the Google synthesis API for real time voice messages, Gratition allows for an automated message to be said to the user concerning his or her day. In addition, Gratition has adjustable voice and lighting to appeal to the users preferences to ensure mental satisfaction throughout the app.

## The Problem

 During the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a decline in mental health throughout the world. In order to address these issues, we considered the possible ways to detect one's current mental state as well as to bring a more positive attitude to such states during the numerous devastations of the pandemic. 

 ## The Solution

 In order to alleviate the steep mental decline that hit due to the pandemic, we created this web app to serve as a “check-in” of a user's current mental state. By doing so, we addressed these issues back to the user and allowed the app to add some positivity to their day. Our detail for certain customization settings and voice messages adds to improve users mentally. At the end, there is a special little message that is curated for the reader to make them feel better.

 In this Web App, we implemented CSS to have smooth transitions & animations, with an efficient dark mode to save the user’s battery life (they can also use light mode if they prefer). We used the Speech Synthesis API created by Google in order to provide natural communication when asking the questions. This API also allows us to create the “solution” to kinda give the user a good laugh!
