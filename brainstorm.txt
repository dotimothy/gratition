Idea 1: Social Destressor Web App (Static)
Languages: Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP
Features (Come up with some stuff):

Plan 1: Minigames: PlaySMR (maybe save for UCI Hacks)
Virtual Stress Ball //We can make this a side bar or like a minigame (HTML Canvas/WebGL/JS)
Balloon Popping //Another minigame/module destressor (HTML Canvas/WebGL/JS)
Anteater Clicker: UCI Anteater eating ants coming from the top of the screen - like cookie clicker but UCI Themed - (HTML Canvas/WebGL/JS)
COVID Defender: Defend your body from COVID-19 (HTML Canvas/WebGL/JS)

Implement a scoreboard (Data is saved using PHP to a Web Server)

Plan 2: Efficient Scheduler (Plan & manages out your day in some way): Gratition
Prompts Questions on How You Start Your Day, when is your free time, and select common activities to put in schedule
When done with the questionnaire, the schedule is created using JS.
User can save the schedule as a png
Could be web app  written in Python/JS and uses cron-scheduler module to schedule events based on user parameters inputted

Let’s try and make the UI for Plan 2 to stand out. How would we phrase the questions so the user feels comfortable answering them (write your thoughts below!)

Make UI good
Audio: add more musical sounds as each question gets completed
Make it visually appealing
Questions should be engaging
Answers should be quick and easy (not short answer types for all, mostly MCQ)
Less words, maybe emojis or pictures? Yes! Should we have a voice read the questions as well? (A natural one) (user picks man or woman’s voice)
We can have like a choose your assistant thing  (at set up)
Google has a pretty good library for that in python
Making transitions seamless for each question (fade transitions or something modern)
Let users pick a schedule theme (cute, dark, modern…, custom)

1. What is your name? (SAQ)
2. How are you feeling today? (MCQ EMOJI)
3. What did I accomplish since waking up? (SAQ)
4. Did these accomplishments make you happy? (MCQ)
    a. super  b. somewhat c. not really d. not at all
5. Name one thing you would like to complete today (SAQ)
6. How many hours of sleep did you get last night? (MCQ)
    a. 10+ hours  b. 7-9 hours  c. 5-6 hours  d. less than 4 hours
7. What time did you go to bed last night? (MCQ)
    a. 8 PM - 9 PM b. 10 PM - 11 PM   c. 11 PM - 12 AM  d. Past 12 AM
8. What made you lose track of time today? (MCQ)
    a. inner turmoil   b. environmental distractions  c. procrastination  d. current events
9. Today I was so _______ (SAQ)
10. When I go to sleep, I want to feel _______ (SAQ)
11. When time are you free today? (Please Indicate Hour and AM/PM) (SAQ)

Plan: Take responses, generate Mad-Lib type decoration as an image
Extra: Have mad-lib be typed out live
